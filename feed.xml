&lt;p&gt;From April 1, 2019, the ICBC ICBC Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) Treatment System will be changed.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, if you come to the clinic with a claim number without the cumbersome pre-processing, you can start the acupuncture treatment immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within 12 weeks of the accident, you can get 12 pre-approved ICBC traffic accident treatments for a minor accident and your expenses are covered. Of course, in case of major injuries, you can receive additional treatment through the approval process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in a car accident, please do not delay and come directly to Ryu Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is well known that Acupuncture treatment also helps to overcome acute / chronic pain treatment and trauma. It is very encouraging that the system will be changed so that various treatments can be selected.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see this article 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-theres-a-chronic-pain-crisis-in-canada-and-governments-must-address/&quot;&gt;There’s a chronic pain crisis in Canada, and governments must address it&lt;/a&gt;, chronic pain affects one in every five Canadians, or six million of us. It’s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike acute pain, chronic pain is characterized by the inability to be solved by taking painkillers. NSAIDS, the most commonly used pain reliever in hospitals, is a medicine that works only for acute pain by inhibiting the enzyme that produces the painful substance to block the last state of inflammation and thereby relieve pain. It is meaningless to prescribe analgesics after the pain has already disappeared in the area where the tissue damage has been occurring for more than a month. Therefore, in the case of chronic pain, the pain medication is ineffective, but it is a reality that it is continuously prescribed. It is not effective and long-term use for more than 10 days increases the risk of cerebral infarction or myocardial infarction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-is-chronic-pain-classified&quot;&gt;How is chronic pain classified?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly when the pain is chronic, the response of the nervous system to the acute pain is affected by various factors including mental or social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic pain is usually chronic nociceptive pain in which the pain signal continues in an injured tissue, and chronic neuropathic pain, which is no longer harmful but continues to be excited by pain conduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be categorized as chronic psychogenic pain, which is disturbed by the circuit that erases the pain memory for psychological reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, chronic pain is not exactly divided into these categories. In most cases, 2-3 kinds of pain are entangled to reveal complex patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, chronic pain is not a simple scheme that suffers from peripheral stimuli such as acute pain, but the pain changes in the spinal cord and brain, causing the pain to increase or change the way you feel the pain. To be more precise, the patient himself is making new pain in the spinal cord or brain, or healing the existing pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, appromimately 60-80% of individuals with an amputation experience phantom sensations in their amputated limb, and the majority of the sensations are painful. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is the well-known case in nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;treatment-of-chronic-pain-with-herbal-medicine&quot;&gt;Treatment of chronic pain with Herbal medicine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In herbal medicine, most prescriptions lead to both physical and mental reactions. In other words, it works both on the body and on the mind. You can expect the spinal cord and brain to act to erase the deformed pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By taking herbal medicine, various systems such as inflammation of the body, microcirculation, moisture distribution, heat production including psychological state can be restored to normal and the result can be the pain disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of acute pain, treatment with herbal medicine increases effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not let any kind of pain, such as back pain, arthralgia, arthritis, rheumatism, shoulder pain, etc., become chronic, and choose a wise healing method after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;auricular-acupuncture&quot;&gt;Auricular Acupuncture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ear is a microsystem which reflects the entire body. Conditions affecting the physical, mental or emotional health of the patient can be treatable by stimulating the surface of the ear with a small seed. It is also called auricular acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/earacu841x425jpeg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Auricular Acupuncture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cupping&quot;&gt;Cupping&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cupping is a therapy designed to stimulate the flow of blood and Qi within the superficial muscles layers. It is used for many ailments including sore muscles, tension, neck pain and the common cold. In the therapy, vacuumed glass or plastic “cups” will be placed over specific areas on your body. They may be moved to an affected area or left in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cupping.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cupping&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moxibustion&quot;&gt;Moxibustion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moxibustion is a treatment that uses an herb called mugwort. It may be burned on the handle of the needle, above the skin, directly on the skin, on salt or on a slice of ginger. This is used to “warm” acupuncture points or areas in order to quicken the healing process. We are also doing Japanese style of direct moxibustion: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.najom.org/&quot;&gt;North America Journal of Oriental Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

## Qigong Therapy
![image-left](https://ryu.clinic/assets/images/qigong841x425jpeg.jpg){: .align-left}  Qigong therapy includes breathing, postures and/or movement. The therapy may be used during treatment or may be taught to patients who need posture correction, increase in energy level, muscle pain relief, and stress relief for regular practice.

&lt;p&gt;Tui-na translates as “push grasp”. It is a massage technique that moves Qi in various parts of the body. It is used to relieve muscle pain, tension, and inflammation and to heal injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that you have heard of acupuncture, and you may even know someone who has experienced it. Acupuncture is the attempt to restore and maintain health through the stimulation of specific anatomical points on the body. It can be done either by a small needle or a laser.[1] If you’re considering trying this alternative medical system yourself, for a condition that is chronic, or one where Western medicine seems to have failed you, here are some ideas for approaching your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;steps&quot;&gt;Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study the concept and system of Oriental acupuncture.&lt;/strong&gt;
Acupuncture has been used for thousands of years in China and Asia.[2] However, it doesn’t follow a Western European method of disease diagnosis and treatment, so it is useful to consider this as an alternative method to rectify your condition.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Read about it in books or magazines.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Talk to an acupuncture practitioner, or to someone who has successfully used it.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Read information on suitable websites, such as government health departments or traditional Chinese medicine schools with a good reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide if you can trust or accept this methodology.&lt;/strong&gt;
If you are extremely adverse to trying it, no one can or should convince you to do so. However, if you are convinced it might work for you, or you’re feeling desperate for another treatment route, acupuncture might be extremely helpful and be exactly what you need. Acupuncture can relieve pain, reduce symptoms, or help restore balance to your body’s system. Only you can decide if it is worth giving it a try.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Be wary of anyone who claims it can cure anything more substantial, however, as it doesn’t cure cancer and cannot save you from an incurable illness.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determine if your insurance plan will cover treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;
If you have decided to try acupuncture, see if it is covered by your insurance plan or your health system’s welfare coverage.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Your doctor might have to refer you for treatment to get it covered. Discuss this idea with your doctor first if you’d like.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If it’s not covered, decide if you can afford to pay out of pocket for it on your own. In case money is an issue search for a local “community style” acupuncturist who treats people in a group setting which cuts costs down on the cost of treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a qualified practitioner.&lt;/strong&gt;
Depending on where you live, you might easily find a qualified acupuncture doctor, or you may not. The NIH, however, has found that acupuncture is being widely practiced by physicians, dentists, acupuncturists, and other practitioners.[1] You will need to check if acupuncture is regulated where you live; a state, province, or region may or may not certify such doctors, making it harder for you to know whether or not your acupuncturist is reputable.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you are having difficulties finding out, inquire in a local Oriental medicine clinic or college for more information.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you know of people who have had successful treatments, ask for their recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Always ask to see their credentials and state license.[1]&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule your first consultation.&lt;/strong&gt;
Go to the acupuncturist and tell him/her your problem. Show your acupuncturist where your pain is, explain your symptoms, tell him/her what you’ve tried before, what you eat, how you sleep. Be open to the acupuncturist’s explanation and suggestions. Expect the explanation to be different from what a Western doctor may say.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand what the treatment consists of.&lt;/strong&gt;
Acupuncture is a system in which you receive a series of up to 20 treatments of up to an hour each (or more), spread out over several weeks. There will usually be a day or two between each treatment or possibly a week depending on your condition. Acupuncture focuses on treating overall well-being and not just the symptoms, taking a holistic approach. This means you must set aside time because it is useless to take only one treatment, or to begin a series and not finish it. Not finishing a course of treatment is a waste of money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for your first treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;
Tell the acupuncturist if this is your first time. He/she will probably explain what is going on in more detail for a new patient. Normally, you will lie on a regular examination or massage bed, and remove clothes from the areas the acupuncturist tells you to. You will be draped in a sheet or towel, plus a blanket if it’s cold. Be sure to wear loose clothing when you go for your appointment.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The acupuncturist will unwrap brand new never used sterile needles from plastic packets. They might also swab the insertion areas with alcohol (this is required for qualified acupuncturists in the USA). You might not see where they will be inserted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relax.&lt;/strong&gt;
Close your eyes and let your muscles loosen. This is a time to focus your energy inward toward healing. Focus on the fact that you have pain or something wrong, and you want to get better. Let this happen.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You will feel a small prick when the needle is inserted. After that first instant, you should feel nothing. If you feel a sudden sharp nerve pain, alert the acupuncturist to let him or her know. He/she might need to remove the needle and insert it in a slightly different place.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The acupuncturist may insert up to 20 different needles at various points, though the first treatment may have fewer. Lie still. Close your eyes. Relax. Visualize the areas of pain or problems, and how they must improve. You should soon feel absolutely nothing. Rest. Take a little nap. Meditate.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pain is subjective, and many people report no or minimal pain from acupuncture.[1] If there is undue pain, alert the practitioner immediately as it may be the result of improper placement of the needles, a defective needle, or your own movement causing a slip.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lie quietly for the duration of treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;
This could be anywhere from 20-60 minutes, less at first. Don’t plan to read, though you could listen to quiet music. It’s best to simply snooze or meditate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t fight the treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;
You have decided to receive acupuncture. Now you must relax, not argue, or stress. Otherwise it won’t work as well. Go with it. If you decide later not to return, that’s your choice. During the treatment, simply lie there. It won’t hurt after the first moment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to relax after the treatment because your muscles need to rest.&lt;/strong&gt;
Bruising is normal if you had needles inserted into you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-short-version-&quot;&gt;The Short Version &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define Community Acupuncture as the practice of offering acupuncture:
1) in a setting where multiple patients receive treatments at the same time;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) by financially sustainable and accountable means, whereby community acupuncture clinics depend directly on the support of the people who receive acupuncture in them, rather than on grants, donations, or other funding;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) within a context of accessibility, which we create by providing consistent hours, by making frequent treatments readily available, by offering affordable services, and by lowering all the barriers to treatment that we possibly can, for as many people as we possibly can, while continuing to be financially self-sustaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-you-afford-to-charge-so-little-to-community-acupuncture&quot;&gt;How can you afford to charge so little to community acupuncture?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we treat lots of people.  What’s most important to a community acupuncturist is simply to give many people the chance to receive treatments. Likewise, the business needs to see many people in order to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plainly said, we want acupuncture to be readily available as a means to help take care of the health of our neighbors and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-i-have-to-take-my-clothes-off-for-community-acupuncture-treatment&quot;&gt;Do I have to take my clothes off for community acupuncture treatment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not.  Occasionally, we may need to have access to areas just above the knee or up to the shoulder joint, in which case we’d ask you to wear shorts or a tee shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But by and large all it takes to get ready for treatment is to roll up pant legs and shirt sleeves, as points on the lower arms and legs are the most commonly used in community clinics.  No need to take any other clothes off.&lt;/p&gt;
